## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Database Verification
- [x] Migration run successfully
- [x] All 4 columns exist
- [x] Constraints applied
- [ ] Test with sample employee data

### Page Flow
- [ ] `/onboarding` redirects to `/onboarding/q1`
- [ ] Q1: Country selection works (optimistic UI)
- [ ] Q1: Company form validates (sector required)
- [ ] Q2: Employee form validates (family status required)
- [ ] Q2: Payslip preview shows correct calculations
- [ ] Q2: Confetti animation triggers
- [ ] Q3: Frequency selector works

### Payroll Correctness
- [ ] Single employee (0 children) ‚Üí fiscalParts = 1.0
- [ ] Married employee (0 children) ‚Üí fiscalParts = 2.0
- [ ] Single + 2 children ‚Üí fiscalParts = 2.0
- [ ] Married + 2 children ‚Üí fiscalParts = 3.0
