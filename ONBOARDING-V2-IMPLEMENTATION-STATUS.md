## üéØ Critical Success Factors

### 1. Family Status Collection (PAYROLL CORRECTNESS)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Backend infrastructure complete, frontend form pending

The employee form MUST collect:
- Marital status (single/married/divorced/widowed)
- Number of dependent children (0-10)

Backend calculates:
- `fiscalParts` = 1.0 + (married ? 1.0 : 0) + (min(children, 4) * 0.5)
- `hasFamily` = (maritalStatus === 'married' || dependentChildren > 0)

### 2. Immediate Payslip Preview (SUCCESS MOMENT)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Backend complete (returns payslipPreview), frontend card pending

After creating employee in Q2:
- Backend calls `calculatePayrollV2()` with fiscalParts
- Returns complete payroll calculation
- Frontend must display prominently with **NET SALARY** in large green text

### 3. Company Sector Collection
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

Company info form includes sector dropdown:
- SERVICES (2% AT), COMMERCE (2% AT), TRANSPORT (3% AT), INDUSTRIE (4% AT), CONSTRUCTION (5% AT)
- Stored in `tenant.sectorCode` for payroll calculations

---

## üìù Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session)
1. Create `employee-form-v2.tsx` with family status fields
2. Create `payslip-preview-card.tsx` for success moment
3. Create `frequency-selector.tsx` and `success-celebration.tsx`
4. Create all 4 page files (q1, q2, q3, success)

### Short-term (This Week)
1. Test complete flow locally
2. Run database migration on development
3. Verify payroll correctness with different family statuses
4. Add loading/error states
5. Test on mobile viewport

### Medium-term (Next Week)
1. User acceptance testing
2. Performance optimization
3. Analytics integration
4. Deploy to staging
5. Gradual rollout with feature flag

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Backward Compatibility:** All old onboarding endpoints are still functional. V2 endpoints are additive.

2. **Migration Safety:** The database migration sets default values for existing employees (single, 0 children, 1.0 fiscal parts).

3. **Testing Required:** Before deploying, MUST verify:
   - Fiscal parts calculation is correct
   - Tax deduction reflects family status
   - CMU employer contribution applies to employees with family
   - Sector-specific work accident rates are used

4. **Performance:** The `createFirstEmployeeV2` function runs in a transaction and returns payslip preview - ensure this completes in < 2 seconds.

5. **Mobile-First:** All components use min-h-[48px] touch targets and responsive design.

---

**Status Summary:** Core infrastructure (database, backend services, tRPC endpoints, base components) is complete. Frontend pages and remaining components need to be implemented to complete the task-first onboarding flow.
