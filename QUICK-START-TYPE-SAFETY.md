# Type Safety - Quick Start Guide

> **TL;DR:** Always use `npm run dev:safe` for development. Pre-commit hooks will catch errors automatically.

---

## 🚀 Start Development

```bash
# Use this command instead of npm run dev
npm run dev:safe
```

This runs **both**:
1. Next.js dev server (http://localhost:3000)
2. TypeScript type checker (shows errors in terminal)

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Type errors hidden until build | Errors shown immediately |
| Commit broken code ❌ | Pre-commit hook blocks ❌ |
| Runtime bugs in production 🐛 | Caught at dev time ✅ |
| Slow feedback loop 🐌 | Instant feedback ⚡ |

---

## ✅ Pre-Commit Checks

When you run `git commit`, these run automatically:
- ✅ TypeScript type checking
- ✅ ESLint with auto-fix

**If blocked:**
```bash
# Fix the errors shown in terminal
# Then commit again

# Emergency bypass (NOT recommended)
git commit --no-verify -m "Hotfix"
```

---

## 📝 Writing Type-Safe Code

### ❌ Don't Do This
```typescript
const data = response as any;  // Loses all type safety
```

### ✅ Do This Instead
```typescript
import type { WorkflowStats } from '@/features/workflows/types/workflow-stats';
const data = response as WorkflowStats;  // Type-safe!
```

---

## 📁 Where Types Live

```
/features/{feature}/types/{type}.ts
```

**Examples:**
- `/features/workflows/types/workflow-stats.ts`
- `/features/time-off/types/time-off.ts`
- `/features/time-tracking/types/overtime.ts`
- `/features/employees/types/salary-components.ts`

---

## 🆘 Common Issues

### "Type error during dev"
→ Check terminal output from `dev:safe`
→ Fix the error shown
→ TypeScript will re-check automatically

### "Pre-commit hook blocked my commit"
→ Fix errors shown in terminal
→ Try commit again
→ Errors must be fixed before committing

### "Build fails but dev works"
→ You're using `npm run dev` instead of `npm run dev:safe`
→ Switch to `dev:safe` to see errors during development

## 🎓 Best Practices

1. ✅ **Always** use `npm run dev:safe`
2. ✅ **Create** proper type definitions (never use `as any`)
3. ✅ **Import** types explicitly: `import type { ... }`
4. ✅ **Add** return types to functions
5. ✅ **Fix** type errors as you see them (don't let them accumulate)
