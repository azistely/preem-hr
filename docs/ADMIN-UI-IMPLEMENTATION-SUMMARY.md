# Admin UI Implementation Summary

**Date:** 7 octobre 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Author:** Claude Code

## Overview

Complete implementation of admin dashboards for time tracking and time-off management, following HCI design principles for low digital literacy users.

## What Was Built

### 1. Admin Layout (`app/admin/layout.tsx`)
- Persistent navigation header
- Links to time tracking and time-off dashboards
- Consistent branding across admin pages
- Mobile-responsive design

### 2. Time Tracking Admin Dashboard (`app/admin/time-tracking/page.tsx`)

**Features:**
- View pending time entries with filters (today/week/month/all)
- Summary widget showing pending count and total overtime hours
- Individual entry cards with:
  - Employee info and photo
  - Clock in/out times
  - Geofence verification status
  - Overtime breakdown by type
  - Photo verification links
  - Employee notes
- Approve/reject individual entries
- Bulk approve all filtered entries
- Real-time updates with optimistic UI

**HCI Compliance:**
- ✅ Zero learning curve - obvious actions with clear labels
- ✅ Touch targets ≥ 44px (56px for primary actions)
- ✅ Progressive disclosure - overtime details collapsible
- ✅ Immediate feedback - toast notifications
- ✅ French only - no English anywhere
- ✅ Smart defaults - "Cette semaine" pre-selected

### 3. Time-Off Admin Dashboard (`app/admin/time-off/page.tsx`)

**Features:**
- View pending leave requests with type filters
- Summary widget showing pending count
- Individual request cards with:
  - Employee info and photo
  - Leave type icon and label
  - Date range and total days
  - Balance impact calculation (before/after)
  - Conflict detection (other employees on leave)
  - Reason/notes
- Approve/reject individual requests
- Bulk approve filtered requests
- Real-time conflict detection

**HCI Compliance:**
- ✅ Task-oriented design - "Approuver les congés" not "Update status"
- ✅ Error prevention - balance validation before approval
- ✅ Cognitive load minimization - show only relevant info
- ✅ Visual hierarchy - important info (balance, conflicts) highlighted
- ✅ Accessibility - semantic colors, clear icons

### 4. Shared Admin Components

#### `TimeEntryApprovalCard` (`components/admin/time-entry-approval-card.tsx`)
- Reusable card for displaying time entries
- Approve/reject actions with confirmation
- Overtime breakdown with collapsible details
- Geofence status badges
- Photo verification links

#### `LeaveRequestCard` (`components/admin/leave-request-card.tsx`)
- Reusable card for displaying leave requests
- Balance impact visualization
- Conflict warning badges
- Approve/reject actions with mandatory reason
- Country-specific leave type icons and labels

#### `PendingSummaryWidget` (`components/admin/pending-summary-widget.tsx`)
- Displays pending count with icon
- Shows total overtime hours (for time tracking)
- Bulk approve button (if applicable)
- Gradient background for visual prominence

### 5. Admin tRPC Endpoints

#### Time Tracking Router (`server/routers/time-tracking.ts`)
New endpoints added:
- `getPendingEntries` - Filter by date range
- `getPendingSummary` - Aggregate metrics
- `bulkApprove` - Approve multiple entries
- `getOvertimeByEmployee` - Detailed overtime breakdown

#### Time-Off Router (`server/routers/time-off.ts`)
New endpoints added:
- `getPendingRequestsWithBalances` - Requests + balance data
- `getPendingSummary` - Aggregate metrics
- `detectConflicts` - Find overlapping approved requests
- `bulkApprove` - Approve multiple requests
- `getAllBalancesSummary` - All employee balances (admin view)

### 6. Documentation

**Admin Guide** (`docs/ADMIN-TIME-MANAGEMENT-GUIDE.md`):
- Complete user guide for HR managers
- Step-by-step instructions with screenshots
- Business rules and compliance information
- Technical architecture reference
- Convention Collective compliance details

## Technical Highlights

### Multi-Country Support
- Country code flows from tenant context
- Overtime rates loaded from database (not hardcoded)
- Country-specific labels (CNPS vs IPRES, ITS vs IRPP)
- Public holidays loaded from database per country

### Overtime Calculation
**Automatic classification:**
- Hours 41-46: +15% (CI, SN, BF)
- Hours 46+: +50%
- Weekend: +50%
- Night (21h-5h): +75%
- Holidays: +100%

**Week boundaries:**
- Monday 0h00 → Sunday 23h59
- Cumulative calculation per week
- Stored in `overtime_breakdown` JSONB field

### Business Days Calculation
**Excludes:**
- Weekends (Saturday, Sunday)
- Public holidays (loaded from `public_holidays` table)

**Function:** `countBusinessDaysExcludingHolidays(startDate, endDate, countryCode)`

### Conflict Detection
**Automatically detects:**
- Overlapping approved leave requests
- Partial or full date range overlap
- Shows employee names and dates

**Non-blocking:**
- Admin can still approve despite conflicts
- Decision based on business context

### Balance Management
**Automatic updates:**
- Request submission: `pending += totalDays`
- Approval: `pending -= totalDays`, `used += totalDays`
- Rejection: `pending -= totalDays` (balance restored)

**Validation:**
- Balance must be ≥ totalDays to approve
- Error thrown if insufficient balance

## Known Limitations

1. **No role-based access control (RBAC)**
   - Admin pages accessible to all authenticated users
   - TODO: Add role check in layout.tsx

2. **No email notifications**
   - Employees not notified on approval/rejection
   - TODO: Integrate with email service

3. **No audit trail**
   - Who approved what, when?
   - TODO: Add audit_logs table and tracking

4. **No calendar view**
   - Leave requests shown as list only
   - TODO: Add calendar visualization component

5. **No export functionality**
   - Cannot export pending entries to Excel/PDF
   - TODO: Add export buttons with PDF generation

## Future Enhancements

9. **Custom approval workflows** - Multi-level approvals
10. **Integration with payroll** - Auto-export approved hours

## Migration Notes

**No database migrations required** - All tables already exist:

- `time_off_balances` (with pending field)

**Router changes:**
- `server/routers/time-tracking.ts` - Added 4 new endpoints
