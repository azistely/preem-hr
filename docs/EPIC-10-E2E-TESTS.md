---

### ✅ Feature 3: Severance Calculation - Article 37 (5 tests)

1. Calculate tiered severance for 10 years seniority
   - **Test case:** 500,000 FCFA/month × 10 years = 1,625,000 FCFA
   - Years 1-5: 5 × 500,000 × 30% = 750,000 FCFA
   - Years 6-10: 5 × 500,000 × 35% = 875,000 FCFA

4. Apply 40% rate for years 11+
5. No severance for misconduct/resignation

**Convention Collective:** Article 37 - Severance pay tiered rates

**Calculation Formula:**
```typescript
severance =
  (min(years, 5) × monthlyAvg × 0.30) +
  (min(max(years - 5, 0), 5) × monthlyAvg × 0.35) +
  (max(years - 10, 0) × monthlyAvg × 0.40)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Authentication:** Tests currently skip login (to be implemented with test users)
