# EPIC Compliance Impact Analysis
**Convention Collective Requirements vs Current EPIC Coverage**

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Status:** üî¥ **CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED**

---

## Executive Summary

The Convention Collective Interprofessionnelle (CI, SN, BF, ML, BJ, TG, GN) establishes **mandatory labor law requirements** that span multiple EPICs and reveal **2 missing EPICs** entirely.

**Findings:**
- ‚úÖ 3 EPICs partially cover requirements (need updates)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 2 EPICs exist but missing critical stories
- ‚ùå 2 NEW EPICs needed for compliance
- üî• P0 features missing from current roadmap

CREATE TYPE leave_category AS ENUM (
  'annual',           -- Cong√©s pay√©s annuels
  'maternity',        -- Cong√© de maternit√© (14 weeks)
  'marriage_employee',-- Mariage de l'employ√© (4 days)

);

-- Seed CI rules
INSERT INTO leave_accrual_rules (tenant_id, country_code, age_threshold, seniority_years, days_per_month, bonus_days, effective_from) VALUES
(NULL, 'CI', NULL, NULL, 2.0, 0, '1977-01-01'), -- Standard: 24 days/year
(NULL, 'CI', 21, NULL, 2.5, 0, '1977-01-01'),   -- Under 21: 30 days/year

## Recommended EPIC Numbering

Since you're currently building EPIC-06 (Payroll), I recommend:

## Multi-Country Implications

**Key Insight:** ALL West African countries (CI, SN, BF, ML, BJ, TG, GN) have similar Convention Collectives with:

- ‚úÖ Employee classification systems (categories/coefficients)
- ‚úÖ Overtime rates (slightly different percentages)
- ‚úÖ Leave entitlements (24-30 days standard)
- ‚úÖ Termination procedures (notice + severance)
- ‚úÖ Special leave types (marriage, birth, death)

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Build features based on CI Convention Collective (most comprehensive)
2. Make all rules **database-configurable** (overtime rates, leave days, etc.)
3. Add other countries by seeding database with their specific rules
4. **NO code changes** needed for new countries

**Database-Driven Configuration:**
```sql
-- Overtime rates table (multi-country)
CREATE TABLE overtime_rates (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  country_code TEXT NOT NULL,
  period_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'weekday_41_48', 'weekday_48_plus', 'saturday', 'sunday', 'holiday', 'night'
  rate_multiplier DECIMAL(3,2) NOT NULL, -- 1.15, 1.50, 1.75, 2.00
  effective_from DATE NOT NULL,
  effective_to DATE
);

-- CI overtime rates
INSERT INTO overtime_rates VALUES
('CI', 'weekday_41_48', 1.15, '1977-01-01', NULL),
('CI', 'weekday_48_plus', 1.50, '1977-01-01', NULL),
('CI', 'saturday', 1.50, '1977-01-01', NULL),
('CI', 'sunday', 1.75, '1977-01-01', NULL),
('CI', 'holiday', 2.00, '1977-01-01', NULL),
('CI', 'night', 1.75, '1977-01-01', NULL);

-- SN overtime rates (slightly different)
INSERT INTO overtime_rates VALUES
('SN', 'weekday_41_48', 1.12, '1980-01-01', NULL), -- Different rate
('SN', 'weekday_48_plus', 1.50, '1980-01-01', NULL),
('SN', 'saturday', 1.50, '1980-01-01', NULL),
('SN', 'sunday', 1.60, '1980-01-01', NULL), -- Different rate
('SN', 'holiday', 2.00, '1980-01-01', NULL),
('SN', 'night', 1.75, '1980-01-01', NULL);
```
