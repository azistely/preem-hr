Use Supabase MCP or direct SQL to verify:

```sql
-- Check employees
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check salary components on employee
SELECT
  e.first_name,
  e.last_name,
  s.components
FROM employees e
JOIN employee_salaries s ON e.id = s.employee_id
WHERE s.components IS NOT NULL;

-- Check custom salary components
SELECT * FROM custom_salary_components
WHERE tenant_id = 'your-tenant-id'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check salary bands
SELECT * FROM salary_bands ORDER BY min_salary;

-- Check payroll runs
SELECT * FROM payroll_runs ORDER BY period_start DESC;

-- Check standard components
SELECT * FROM salary_component_definitions
WHERE country_code = 'CI'
ORDER BY display_order;

-- Check template library
SELECT * FROM salary_component_templates
WHERE country_code = 'CI' AND is_popular = true;
```
