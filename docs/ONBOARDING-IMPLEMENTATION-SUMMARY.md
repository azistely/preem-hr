# Questionnaire-Based Onboarding Implementation Summary

**Date:** January 7, 2025 (Updated: October 7, 2025)
**Epic:** 08-EPIC-ONBOARDING-WORKFLOW.md
**Status:** ✅ Phase 1, 2, 3 & 4 Complete - ALL ONBOARDING PATHS FULLY FUNCTIONAL 🎉

---

## 🎯 Overview

Implemented a comprehensive questionnaire-based discovery and adaptive onboarding system that personalizes the setup experience based on company size and complexity. The system intelligently shows only relevant steps to each user, making onboarding simple for solo businesses while supporting complex enterprise setups.

---

## 📦 What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend Infrastructure

#### Service Layer (`features/onboarding/services/onboarding.service.ts`)

**Core Functions:**
- `getOnboardingState()` - Retrieves current onboarding state from tenant settings
- `answerQuestion()` - Saves questionnaire answers and auto-completes when done
- `determineOnboardingPath()` - Maps company size to onboarding path (SOLO, SMALL_TEAM, MEDIUM, LARGE)
- `getPathPreview()` - Generates personalized step list based on questionnaire answers
- `startOnboarding()` - Initializes onboarding journey after questionnaire
- `completeStep()` - Marks step complete and advances to next
- `completeOnboarding()` - Finalizes onboarding and sets completion timestamp
- `resetQuestionnaire()` - Allows users to re-answer questions
- `getOnboardingSummary()` - Provides data for completion screen

**Step-Specific Functions (Phase 2 & 3):**
- `selectCountry()` - Updates tenant.countryCode and currency
- `setCompanyInfo()` - Updates tenant name, taxId, industry, stores address/phone/email in settings
- `createFirstEmployee()` - Creates position, employee record, assignment, and salary with auto-injected components

**Phase 4 Functions (Multi-Employee Paths):**
- `addEmployeeToOnboarding()` - Adds employee during small team wizard (similar to createFirstEmployee)
- `validateEmployeeImport()` - Validates CSV content before import, returns detailed error report
- `importEmployeesFromCSV()` - Imports employees from validated CSV (calls addEmployeeToOnboarding for each)
- `getEmployeeImportTemplate()` - Generates downloadable CSV template with French headers
- `createDepartments()` - Creates multiple departments (stored in tenant.settings for now)

**State Storage:**
- All onboarding state stored in `tenant.settings.onboarding` JSONB field
- Includes questionnaire answers, current step, completed steps, path type
- Automatically saved after each action (resume-friendly)

**Adaptive Path Logic:**
```typescript
// 4 distinct paths based on company size
SOLO:        1-10 minutes  (< 10 employees)
SMALL_TEAM:  15 minutes    (2-10 employees)
MEDIUM:      20-25 minutes (11-50 employees)
LARGE:       30 minutes    (51+ employees)

// Steps adapt based on 7 questionnaire answers:
1. company_size → determines base path
2. has_departments → shows/hides department setup
3. contract_types → shows/hides contract wizard
4. compensation → shows/hides allowances/commissions
5. time_tracking → shows/hides pointage config
6. time_off → shows/hides leave policies
7. payroll_frequency → sets default schedule
```

#### tRPC Router (`server/routers/onboarding.ts`)

**Endpoints:**
- `onboarding.getQuestionnaireState` - Current questionnaire progress
- `onboarding.answerQuestion` - Save answer and advance
- `onboarding.getPathPreview` - Get personalized step list
- `onboarding.startOnboarding` - Begin onboarding journey
- `onboarding.getState` - Current onboarding state
- `onboarding.completeStep` - Mark step done
- `onboarding.complete` - Finalize onboarding
- `onboarding.resetQuestionnaire` - Reset answers
- `onboarding.getSummary` - Completion screen data
- `onboarding.selectCountry` - Select country (Phase 2)
- `onboarding.setCompanyInfo` - Set company details (Phase 2)
- `onboarding.createFirstEmployee` - Create first employee/owner (Phase 3)
- `onboarding.addEmployee` - Add employee in small team wizard (Phase 4)
- `onboarding.downloadEmployeeTemplate` - Download CSV template (Phase 4)
- `onboarding.validateEmployeeImport` - Validate CSV before import (Phase 4)
- `onboarding.importEmployees` - Import employees from CSV (Phase 4)
- `onboarding.createDepartments` - Create departments (Phase 4)

**Validation:**
- Zod schemas for all inputs
- Type-safe enum values for questions/answers
- Proper error handling with French messages

## 🔧 Technical Details

### State Management
```typescript
// Stored in tenant.settings.onboarding
interface OnboardingState {
  questionnaire_complete: boolean;
  questionnaire_answers: QuestionnaireAnswers;
  current_step: string | null;
  completed_steps: string[];
  path: OnboardingPath | null;
  onboarding_complete: boolean;
  onboarding_completed_at: string | null;
}
```

### Path Generation Logic
```typescript
// Example: Medium organization with time tracking
{
  company_size: 'medium',
  has_departments: true,
  compensation: 'with_allowances',
  time_tracking: 'overtime',
  time_off: 'legal_only',
}

// Generates:
[
  'country_selection',      // Core (all paths)
  'company_info',           // Core (all paths)
  'departments_setup',      // Medium/Large only
  'bulk_import',            // Medium/Large only
  'compensation_components', // If not fixed_salary
  'time_tracking_config',   // If not none
  'time_off_policies',      // If not none
  'approval_workflows',     // Medium/Large only
  'payroll_preview',        // Core (all paths)
  'completion',             // Core (all paths)
]
```

### Resume Capability
- State auto-saved after each action
- On login, checks `current_step`
- Redirects to `/onboarding/steps/[stepId]`
- Shows progress from where they left off

## 💡 Key Insights

### What Worked Well
1. **Questionnaire-first approach** - Understanding user needs upfront simplifies everything downstream
2. **Progressive disclosure** - One question at a time reduces cognitive load dramatically
3. **Adaptive paths** - Different flows for different company sizes prevents overwhelming small users
4. **State persistence** - Auto-save enables resume, reduces frustration
5. **Visual design** - Large icons and cards make choices obvious

### Design Decisions
1. **JSONB for state** - Flexible schema allows easy iteration
2. **Path generation** - Server-side logic ensures consistency
3. **Dynamic routes** - Single step template reduces code duplication
4. **Confetti celebration** - Positive reinforcement improves perception

### Lessons Learned
1. Start with simple paths (solo), add complexity later
2. Test with actual users early (especially low digital literacy)
3. Measure actual completion times vs estimates
4. Monitor drop-off points in questionnaire
5. A/B test question wording for clarity
