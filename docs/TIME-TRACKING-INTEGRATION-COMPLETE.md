### ✅ Test Data (Complete)
- Geofence: Abidjan Plateau office (200m radius)
- Employee: Kouamé Yao (ID: 51db41f0-5792-4a58-be28-fdbc306df997)
- Time entries: 6 entries with overtime (45h week + 4h weekend)
- Time-off policies: Annual leave (24 days), Sick leave (15 days), Maternity (98 days)
- Balances: 24 days annual, 15 days sick

---

## How to Test

### 1. Access the Pages

**Development Server:** http://localhost:3001

**Time Tracking:** http://localhost:3001/time-tracking
- View current week's entries
- See overtime summary (5h overtime from test data)
- Click "Pointer l'arrivée" to clock in

**Time-Off:** http://localhost:3001/time-off
- View balances (24 days annual leave, 15 days sick)
- Click "Nouvelle demande" to request time off
- Browse pending/approved/rejected tabs

---

### 2. Test Clock In/Out

**Mock GPS Location (for testing without GPS):**
```typescript
// In ClockInButton component, the geofence validation is optional
// Works without GPS - just won't show geofence verification badge
```

**To Test with Real GPS:**
1. Open DevTools → Console
2. Override geolocation:
```javascript
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition = (success) => {
  success({
    coords: {
      latitude: 5.3200,  // Abidjan Plateau (within geofence)
      longitude: -4.0200,
      accuracy: 10
    }
  });
};
```
3. Click "Pointer l'arrivée"
4. Should see green checkmark (geofence verified)

**Expected Flow:**
1. Click "Pointer l'arrivée" → Shows loading
2. GPS captured → Location validated
3. Time entry created → Toast: "Arrivée enregistrée"
4. Button changes to "Pointer le départ"
5. Click "Pointer le départ" → Records clock out
6. Shows total hours worked

---

### 3. Test Overtime Detection

**View Overtime Summary:**
1. Go to http://localhost:3001/time-tracking
2. Scroll to "Heures supplémentaires ce mois"
3. Should show:
   - Total: 9h (5h from Mon-Fri + 4h weekend)
   - Breakdown:
     - Heures 41-46 (×1.15): 5h
     - Weekend (×1.75): 4h

**Test Data Created:**
- Mon-Fri: 9h/day = 45h total
- 40h regular + 5h overtime (hours 41-46)
- Saturday: 4h weekend work (×1.75 multiplier)

---

### 4. Test Time-Off Request

**Request Annual Leave:**
1. Go to http://localhost:3001/time-off
2. Click "Nouvelle demande"
3. Select "Congés annuels (standard)" policy
4. Choose dates (e.g., Oct 20-24 = 5 days)
5. Add optional reason
6. Click "Soumettre la demande"

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Shows "5 jours" calculation (excludes weekends)
- ✅ Shows balance impact: "Solde après: 19 jours" (24 - 5)
- ⚠️ If requesting > 24 days: Shows "Solde insuffisant" warning
- ✅ After submit: Appears in "En attente" tab
- ✅ Balance shows "5 jours en attente"

---

### 5. Test Compliance (Time-Off Templates)

**Verify Convention Collective Compliance:**

**🔒 Locked Policy (Cannot Modify):**
```sql
-- Try to query annual leave template
SELECT name->>'fr', compliance_level, legal_reference, can_deactivate
FROM time_off_policy_templates
WHERE code = 'ANNUAL_LEAVE_STANDARD_CI';

-- Result:
-- name: "Congés annuels (standard)"
-- compliance_level: "locked"
-- legal_reference: "Convention Collective Article 28"
-- can_deactivate: false
```

**⚙️ Configurable Policy (Within Bounds):**
```sql
-- Sick leave can be 10-30 days
SELECT min_accrual_rate, default_accrual_rate, max_accrual_rate
FROM time_off_policy_templates
WHERE code = 'SICK_LEAVE_CI';

-- Result: min=10, default=15, max=30
```

**🎨 Freeform (Future Feature):**
- Companies will be able to create custom policies
- No legal restrictions (e.g., remote work days)

## Payroll Integration

### How Overtime Flows to Payroll

**Step 1: Get Overtime Data**
```typescript
import { getTimeTrackingDataForPayroll } from '@/features/time-tracking/services/payroll-integration.service';

const overtimeData = await getTimeTrackingDataForPayroll({
  employeeId: 'employee-uuid',
  periodStart: new Date('2025-10-01'),
  periodEnd: new Date('2025-10-31'),
});

// Returns:
{
  regularHours: 160,
  overtimeBreakdown: {
    hours_41_to_46: 5,    // × 1.15 multiplier
    hours_above_46: 0,
    night_work: 0,
    weekend: 4,           // × 1.75 multiplier
    holiday: 0
  },
  totalOvertimeHours: 9,
  totalOvertimePay: 15678  // Pre-calculated
}
```

**Step 2: Add to Payroll Calculation**
```typescript
import { calculatePayrollV2 } from '@/features/payroll/services/payroll-calculation-v2';

const payroll = await calculatePayrollV2({
  employeeId,
  countryCode: 'CI',
  periodStart,
  periodEnd,
  baseSalary: 300000,
  // Add overtime from time tracking
  overtimeHours: overtimeData.overtimeBreakdown,
});

// Payroll automatically applies multipliers:
// - Hours 41-46: × 1.15 (from overtime_rules table)
// - Weekend: × 1.75 (from overtime_rules table)
```

**Example Calculation:**
```
Base Salary: 300,000 FCFA
Hourly Rate: 300,000 / 173.33 = 1,731 FCFA/hour

Overtime Pay:
- Hours 41-46 (5h × 1.15): 5 × 1,731 × 1.15 = 9,953 FCFA
- Weekend (4h × 1.75): 4 × 1,731 × 1.75 = 12,117 FCFA
Total Overtime: 22,070 FCFA

Gross Salary: 300,000 + 22,070 = 322,070 FCFA
```
