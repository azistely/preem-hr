- `employee.status.changed` - Update workflows, notify stakeholders
- `employee.assignment.changed` - Update payroll, notify parties

**Leave Events (5 types):**
- `leave.request.created` - Create approval workflow
- `leave.request.rejected` - Notify employee with reason
- `leave.approved` - Update balance, apply deductions
- `leave.balance.low` - Alert employee and manager
- `leave.upcoming` - Notify team, ensure coverage

**Payroll Events (4 types):**
- `payroll.run.started` - Track progress
- `payroll.run.completed` - Generate reports, send notifications
- `payroll.run.failed` - Alert finance team
- `payroll.payment.processed` - Update status, confirmations

**Contract Events (3 types):**
