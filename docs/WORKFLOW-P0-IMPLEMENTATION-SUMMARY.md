# Workflow Automation P0 Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Epic:** 09-EPIC-WORKFLOW-AUTOMATION.md
**Completion Status:** ✅ 100% (All P0 tasks completed)

## Overview

Successfully implemented all P0 critical tasks for the Workflow Automation Epic, achieving MVP completion with comprehensive testing, error handling, and production-ready async processing.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Schema Mismatch Fix (P0 - Critical) ✅
**File:** `/Users/admin/Sites/preem-hr/lib/workflow/alert-engine.ts`

**Problem Identified:**
- Code referenced `assignments.status` field that doesn't exist in database
- Code referenced `assignments.terminationDate` field that doesn't exist
- Query logic didn't properly check employee active status

**Solution Implemented:**
- Updated query to use `employees.status` instead of `assignments.status`
- Updated query to use `employees.terminationDate` instead of `assignments.terminationDate`
- Added proper employee status checks in alert creation logic
- Fixed `contract.type` → `contract.assignmentType` field mismatch
- Verified against actual database schema via Drizzle relations

**Impact:**
- Alert engine now correctly identifies expiring contracts for active employees
- No more runtime errors from non-existent fields
- Proper filtering of terminated/inactive employees

### 2. Core Unit Tests (P0) ✅

**Test Results:**
```bash
Test Files  2 passed (2)
Tests       35 passed (35)
Duration    2.79s
```

- ✅ Cron expression: `0 5 * * *`
- ✅ Retry configuration: 3 retries with exponential backoff
- ✅ Rate limiting: Max once per hour
- ✅ Manual trigger support via `alerts/generate.manual` event

#### Health Check Monitoring
**File:** `/Users/admin/Sites/preem-hr/lib/inngest/functions/health-check.ts`
- ✅ Scheduled to run hourly: `0 * * * *`
- ✅ Monitors:
  - Database connectivity (latency tracking)
  - Pending alerts (>15 min old)
  - Stuck batch operations (>1 hour running)
  - Overdue urgent alerts (>24 hours)
- ✅ Creates admin alerts when system is degraded/unhealthy
- ✅ Manual trigger support via `health/check.manual` event

### 4. Background Job Queue Migration (P0) ✅

#### Batch Operation Processor
**File:** `/Users/admin/Sites/preem-hr/lib/inngest/functions/batch-operation-processor.ts`
- ✅ Async processing of batch operations
- ✅ Event-driven: triggered by `batch.operation.created`
- ✅ Concurrency control: Max 3 operations across all tenants
- ✅ Per-tenant limiting: One batch op at a time per tenant
- ✅ Retry logic: 2 retries on failure

#### Batch Operation Completed Handler
**File:** `/Users/admin/Sites/preem-hr/lib/inngest/functions/batch-operation-completed.ts`
- ✅ Creates completion alerts for users
- ✅ Handles success/error reporting
- ✅ Prepared for email/SMS notifications (TODO)

#### tRPC Router Integration
**File:** `/Users/admin/Sites/preem-hr/server/routers/batch-operations.ts`
- ✅ Updated `updateSalaries` mutation to trigger Inngest event
- ✅ Updated `retryFailed` mutation to trigger Inngest event
- ✅ Removed blocking synchronous processing
- ✅ Returns immediately with "en cours de traitement" message
